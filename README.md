## Introduction

[Craft Editor](https://craft.sova.dev/) is a Notion-style WYSIWYG editor with AI extensions support.

<br />

## Installation

To use Craft Editor in a project, you can run the following command to install the `@sergeysova/craft` [NPM package](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@sergeysova/craft):

```
npm add @sergeysova/craft
```

Then, you can use it in your code like this:

```jsx
import { CraftEditor } from "@sergeysova/craft";

export default function App() {
  return <CraftEditor />;
}
```

## Setting Up Locally

To set up Novel locally, you'll need to clone the repository.

If you've deployed this to Vercel, you can also use [`vc env pull`](https://vercel.com/docs/cli/env#exporting-development-environment-variables) to pull the environment variables from your Vercel project.

To run the app locally, you can run the following commands:

```
pnpm i
pnpm build
pnpm dev
```

## Fork

This project is a full fork of [Novel](https://github.com/steven-tey/novel) made by Steven Tey.

The main reason for fork was adding more customisation abilities without needs to support backward compatibility.

## Roadmap

- Make CraftEditor controlled to easily integrate with any state-manager
- Move AI features to an extension to allow user use it or not
- Move image uploading features to an extension
- Allow to install any other kinds of blocks to command popup
- Make CraftEditor fully independent of Vercel (uploading, ai, analytics, etc.)
