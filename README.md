## Introduction

Then, you can use it in your code like this:

```

## Fork

This project is an enhanced version of [Novel](https://github.com/steven-tey/novel), originally created by Steven Tey. I am forked it to introduce additional customization options, all without the constraints of maintaining backward compatibility of Novel.

I am created `@sergeysova/craft` with the aim of offering a more modular and customizable editor experience. My changes include updating dependencies, streamlining the default editor content, and disabling certain features like the Image block and AI support. These features are not gone for good; rather, I am planning to reintroduce them as optional extensions, giving you the freedom to tailor the editor to your needs.

## Roadmap

- **Documentation**: To provide detailed guides and tutorials for extending functionalities, integrating with state managers, and utilizing AI capabilities.
- **Craft Editor Control**: To seamlessly integrate with any state manager.
- **Modular AI Features**: Move AI capabilities to an extension for optional use.
- **Image Uploading as an Extension**: To give you the choice to include it or not.
- **Command Popup Customization**: Allowing the installation of various block types.
- **Independence from Vercel**: Making CraftEditor fully self-reliant for uploading, AI, analytics, and more.
- **Notion-like Menu**: For each line, features for transforming, settings, deletion, etc., will be available.

By making these changes, we aim to provide a more flexible and user-friendly editor that can be easily integrated into your existing tech stack.
